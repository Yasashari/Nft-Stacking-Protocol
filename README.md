## Stacking : 
	First connet your metamsk wallet . Please make sure to change your chain to mumbai testnet before connecting. 
    You can enter token Id and hit enable button. Metamask will be poped up and give nessasary permissions.
    Click stake button for stacking Nft.
    Once you stack TribG nft you can get TRBX tokens based on the time you stack and amount of nft stack.
	
  ### How to get your token Id:
	You can get it either using opensea testnet or nftmarketplace repo.
    

## Smart Contract :
	I create this contract from scratch , also use ERC20 , IERC721 and ReentrancyGuard contract from OppenZeppelin.
